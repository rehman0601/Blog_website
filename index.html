        <h2>My Daily Life</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Every day starts with a warm cup of tea and a moment of quiet. I usually begin my morning by going through my to-do list, checking emails, and getting ready for the tasks ahead. Whether it’s studying, working on web projects, or just catching up on learning something new, I like to keep my mind engaged.

        Afternoons are often a mix of productivity and breaks. I like to take short walks or listen to music to recharge. Evenings are for winding down — I might spend time with family, read, or work on personal hobbies like writing or coding. It’s a simple but fulfilling routine.

          <h3>Finding Balance</h3>
          <p><strong>By Me, April 23, 2025</strong></p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Lately, I've been focusing on maintaining a better balance between screen time and rest. It's easy to get caught up in online work, but I'm learning to take breaks and enjoy the little things — like a walk in the sun or a good meal. It's all part of growing and taking care of yourself.
